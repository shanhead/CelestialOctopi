   *Constraints:* None  
   *Effort Estimation:* 4 person-hours  
   *Acceptance Test:* New users should be able to start the game and understand the rules and mechanics of the game with ease, without needing to ask for clarification from the development team.  

 * #### 1.2: Easily Accessible
   **As a tournament organizer, I want a game that community members and others can pick up quickly for casual tournaments, so that more people might join in our game nights and other events.**  
   *Elaboration:* Many card games aren't easily accessible to new players, both in difficulty and financially. We aim to create a game which is freely accessed and which has an intuitive set of rules that can be learned easily.  
   *Constraints:* None  
   *Effort Estimation:* 2 person-hours  
   *Acceptance Test:* After holding a small tournament with 8 people, a brief survey will be administered to gauge the players' feelings on the card game and their experiences should show at least 50% of players had positive feelings about the tournament.

* ### 2: Game Mechanics and Archetypes
 **As an experienced card game player, I want to use game mechanics that are fun and innovative, so that it stands out from other games I've played.**  
 *Elaboration:* In this context, a card game mechanic refers to certain ways that cards interact with each other. For example, several cards might all share a certain effect, which might also synergize with other cards of its type. A deck might be built around this mechanic, and this would create a deck archetype.  
 *Constraints:* Mechanics should be relatively balanced with each other-- that is to say, no mechanic or deck archetype should stand out from the others as being extremely good or weak compared to others. This will require extensive playtesting.  
 *Effort Estimation:* 2 person-hours  
 *Acceptance Test:* Beta testers will be introduced to the rules and asked to play a few games with each other; a subsequent survey on their enjoyment of the game should show that at least 50% felt positively about their experiences with game mechanics.

 *Elaboration:* Deckbuilding can be a stressful experience for new players (particularly those new to card games) who don't yet have a grasp on game rules or mechanics. If they build a suboptimal deck and lose repeatedly, it can lead to frustration Therefore, they should be provided the option of ready-made, balanced decks with which to learn.  
 *Constraints:* None

   *Effort Estimation:* 1 person-hour  
   *Acceptance Test:* A card should be magnified if a user hovers their mouse over it for some duration of time. This enlarged version should appear in a consistent location, and disappear when the user begins to drag the card or moves their mouse away from it.  

* ###  6: Statistics Tracking

   *Constraints:* This card information will also be easily accessible to the user via   
   *Effort Estimation:* 2 person-hours  
   *Acceptance Test:* The program will be able to facilitate card interactions of an entire game, using card data (manna cost, attack/health, any other effects) without requiring user input outside of normal user decisions.
   
  
  
  * ###  7: Combat defense mechanincs
 **As a player, I want the game to keep track of how much damage I can give and receive to/from my opponent in the game using either normal attacks or spell attacks.**

   **As a player, I want the game to keep track of mine and my opponent's life totals, so that I can focus on game strategy.**  
   *Elaboration:* The game should pay attention to both players' life totals and display them on screen, and determine when a player gets damaged by an incoming attack from another player.
